# Ft_printf

## Overview

`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the `printf` function in the C programming language. This function allows you to format and print text to the standard output or a specified output stream. `ft_printf` supports various format specifiers, such as `%s`, `%d`, `%x`, and more, providing versatile text formatting capabilities.

This repository contains a sample implementation of the `ft_printf` function, along with usage examples to help you understand how to integrate it into your C projects.

## Features

- Supports a wide range of format specifiers, including `%s`, `%d`, `%x`, `%f`, and more.
- Enables custom formatting options through flags and modifiers.
- Handles variable-length argument lists (varargs) like the standard `printf`.
- Compatible with Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows.

## Usage

### Including `ft_printf` in Your Project

1. Clone this repository or download the `ft_printf.c` and `ft_printf.h` files.

2. Add the `ft_printf.c` and `ft_printf.h` files to your project's source code directory.

3. Include the `ft_printf.h` header in your source files where you intend to use `ft_printf`.

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"
```

### Function Signature

```c
int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);
```

## Example Usage

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    char *str = "Hello, world!";

    // Format and print text
    ft_printf("Integer: %d\n", num);
    ft_printf("String: %s\n", str);
    return (0);
}
```

## Build and Run

You can compile the example code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
```bash
gcc -o example example.c ft_printf.c -I.
```
Then, run the compiled executable:
```bash
./example
```

## Format Specifiers

`ft_printf` supports a wide range of format specifiers and formatting options. Refer to the [official printf format specifiers documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf) for details on how to use them in your format strings.
